# DIABLOS Framework
DIABLOS is the Anagram for "Does It All By Leveraging Open Source". The name came from my wife, who also started it by Does it all by learning objectives, but after some discussion and working through what this Framework does, we agreed on adding an "S" to DIABLO, and changing it to leveraging open source.

This **Framework**, is the beginning work of several functions, and scripts compiled into one easy to use call. This framework is one of the simplest frameworks you'll ever use. Imagine this system as an extension to PHP. It allows you to have several new reusable code snippets just as easily as typing and sending the parameters. This system allows you to build a complete system with one call on your index page.

Using the menu to the right, take a look at the [Functions](Functions) wiki of this Framework. If this is a framework you would like to add to your project, take a look at the [Installation](Installation) wiki of this Framework.
